Instructions for putting together the ViPer Headset:

1) Print motor_mirror_attachment, panel_behind_fixed_mirror, and bottom_frame using PLA.
2) Laser cut top_frame and frame_headset_interface.
3) Remove the front panel of the Google Daydream View headset.
4) Remove the insert inside the headset that rests on the face.
5) Drill four holes into the outer plastic that align with the four holes in the frame_headset_interface. The part of the headset that protrudes on the bottom should slot right into the interface.
6) Screw the frame_headset_interface onto the headset using the M2.5 screws and secure with hex nuts.
7) Assemble and secure the panel_behind_fixed_mirror, top_frame, and the frame_headset_interface with adhesives of your choice.
8) Attach the smaller mirror to the inside of the panel_behind_fixed_mirror.
9) Cover all holes with construction paper. This is an important step -- the participant's view must be obscured, but the paper ensures that it is a lightweight solution.
10) Insert M3 screw into the hole of the motor_mirror_attachment, such that it portrudes and can fit into the hole in the bottom_frame.
11) Secure the motor_mirror_attachment to the back of the large mirror with adhesives of your choice.
12) Solder the motor, the correct wires, the button, and the resistor to the Arduino UNO shield and attach it to the UNO.
13) Screw the motor onto the top of the ViPer frame using the M4 screws and secure with hex nuts.
14) Attach the motor_mirror_attachment (now attached to the large mirror) to the motor and make sure the M3 screw is dropped directly into the intended hole in the bottom_frame.
15) Secure the Arduino UNO to the top of the headset with adhesives of your choice.
17) Replace the insert inside the headset that rests on the face back inside of the headset.

Optional: If the headset feels unstable or unsecure, print the screw_tube using PLA. Align the tube with the small holes on the top and bottom of the frame next to the servo motor. Take two M2.5 screws and washers and tighten them down to either side of the tube to help hold the headset in place.
